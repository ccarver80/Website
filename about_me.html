    <div class="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
         My name is Chris Carver and I live in North Dakota. I am a computer nerd at heart, I grew up in the 90's with a 1998
         computer. I was always fascinated with how it worked inside and out so much that once we upgraded our computer to a newer Dell
         in the 2000's, I remember tearing apart the old Gateway and inspecting all the components.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've always been the computer guru of the family, when someone has a problem and they come to me I usually dive right
        into the problem and try my hardest to figure out what is going on. More often than not I teach myself something new in the
        process.
      </p>

      <p>
         I grew up in a oilfield family, I have been working in the oilfield my whole life. Deciding that I don't have any other skills,
         I sat down one day and started teaching myself how to program and code. I started with Python, as research told me it was one of the easiest
         languages and one of the most popular. I branched off that a bit and started learning web development as well. I started to build this website
         as I  was learning. There were multiple times that I got frustrated and deleted all the HTML and CSS and started over.
      </p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        I have had many hobbies, from raising chickens, to gazing at the stars at night with my telescope. Below is a list of my hobbies
        and a quick description on each.
      </p>

        <h3>Hockey</h3>
        <p>
         I played hockey growing up
         and now that I'm older I am part of a mens leauge (old man hockey) at the local skating rink. I played goalie as a kid and finding
         goalies for mens leauge can be hard to come by.
       </p>

        <h3>Ebay</h3>
        <p>
          I started selling stuff on eBay in 2019 for some side cash, I will go all over to garage sales and thrift stores and find objects
          to sell on eBay for a little extra income.
        </p>

        <h3>Astronomy</h3>
        <p>
          Bored one day in 2019, I googled "Father and son hobbies" and #2 on a list was "Buy a telescope", so that is just what I did.
          I was a cheap $100 telescope from eBay, but I was hooked and upgraded later to a much bigger and expensive one and learned alot
          about space and astronomy.
        </p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>
          Growing up I was a Nintendo kid. My first console was a Nintendo 64. I still remeber the countless hours playing Goldeneye with my freinds.
          My Nintendo 64 got upgraded to the Gamecube then to the Nintendo Wii.
        </p>
